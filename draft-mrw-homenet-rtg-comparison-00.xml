      <t>
	This document is intended to provide information to members of
	the IETF Home Networks Working Group (HOMENET WG), so that we
	can make an informed decision regarding which routing protocol
	to use in home networks.  The routing protocols compared
	in this document are: The Babel Routing Protocol (Babel) and
	The Intermediate System to Intermediate System Intra-Domain
	Routing Protocol (IS-IS).

    <section title="Introduction"> 
      <t>
	This document compares IS-IS (ISO/IEC 10589:2002) and Babel
	<xref target="RFC6126"/> across several criteria related to
	their use in home networks, as defined by the HOMENET WG
	(HOMENETs).
      </t>
      <t>
	Although there are substantial difference between the IS-IS
	and Babel routing protocols, both routing protocols work well,
	and either of them could be used in a home network.  There are
	many characteristics of these protocols that make them more or
	less suitable for use in HOMENETs, as defined in
	(reference homenet architecture and HNCP documents), and those
	characteristics are explored in this document.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Protocols and Extensions Included in Comparison">
      <t>
	Both IS-IS and Babel are living protocols that are updated and
	extended over time.  This section lists the extensions that
	were considered in this comparison.  Additional protocol
	extensions could affect some of the information included in this
	document.
      </t>
      <section title="IS-IS Protocol and Extensions">
	<t>
	  In addition to the base IS-IS protocol specification
	  (ISO/IEC 10589:2002), this comparison considers the
	  following IS-IS extensions:

      </section>
      <section title="Babel Protocol and Extensions">
	<t> 
	  In addition to the base Babel Protocol specification (RFC
	  6126), this comparison considers the following Babel 
	  extensions:

      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Routing Algorithms">
      <t>
	IS-IS is a Link State routing protocol, and Babel is a
	Distance Vector routing protocol. There are some differences
	between these algorithms, particularly in terms of
	scalability, how much information is exchanged when the
	routing topology changes, and how far topology changes are
	propogated.

    <section title="Support for Source-Specific Routing">
      <t>
	Source-Specific Routing is a hard requirement for HOMENETs, as
	it will allow traffic to be routed to the correct outbound
	network based on host source address selection.  Routing
	packets to the wrong outbound network could result in packets
	being dropped due to ISP ingress filtering rules.

      </section>
      <section title="Discussion">
      <t>
	Reports indicate that both IS-IS and Babel have critical
	issues (routing loops) in a mixed environment where some
	routers support Source-Specific Routing, and some routers do
	not.  However, this is not likely to be a problem for Homenet,
	as we will require Source-Specific Routing on all routers.

    <section title="Support for Multicast">
      <t>
	Although the HOMENET WG has not yet determined how/if to
	support multicast in HOMENET Networks, it might be desirable
	to pick a routing protocol that supports multicast, so that it
	will be easier to add multicast support in the future.

	There are Homenet implementations of both IS-IS and Babel.

	There are several independent, interoperable implementations
	of IS-IS, including open source implementations.  There is

      <section title="IS-IS Standardization">
	<t>
	  IS-IS is an ISO Standard documented in ISO/IEC 10589:2002.
	  There is an active IETF IS-IS Working Group (ISIS) that
	  maintains and extends the IS-IS protocol, and the IS-IS
	  protocol has been extended in several ISIS Working Group
	  documents.

      <section title="Babel Standardization Status">
	<t>
	  Babel is documented in an Experimental RFC (RFC 6126)
	  published in 2011, and it has been updated in several
	  individual-submission RFCs.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The use of Babel in a Standards Track HOMENET RFC would
	  require a "down ref" to non-Standards Track documents.  It
	  would also be necessary to publish the extensions that are
	  needed for the HOMENET use case as RFCs.
