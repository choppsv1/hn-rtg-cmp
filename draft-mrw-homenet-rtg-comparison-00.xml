      <t>
	This document is intended to provide information to members of
	the IETF Home Networks Working Group (HOMENET WG), so that we
	can make an informed decision regarding which routing protocol
	to use in home networks.  The routing protocols compared
	in this document are: The Babel Routing Protocol (Babel) and
	The Intermediate System to Intermediate System Intra-Domain
	Routing Protocol (IS-IS).

	This document compares IS-IS (ISO/IEC 10589:2002) <xref

	several criteria related to their use in home networks, as
	defined by the HOMENET WG (HOMENETs).
      </t>
      <t>
	Although there are substantial differences between the IS-IS
	and Babel routing protocols, both routing protocols work well,
	and either of them could be used in a home network.  There are
	many characteristics of these protocols that make them more or
	less suitable for use in HOMENETs, as defined in
	(reference homenet architecture and HNCP documents), and those
	characteristics are explored in this document.

    <section title="Routing Algorithms">
      <t>
	IS-IS is a Link State routing protocol, and Babel is
	a Loop-avoiding Distance Vector routing protocol. There are some
	differences between these algorithms, particularly in terms of
	scalability, how much information is exchanged when the routing
	topology changes, and how far topology changes are propagated.

        [chopps: Perhaps we should see if we can find an external reference for
        comparing DVRP to link-state RPs for this section].

      </t>
      <section title="Link State Algorithm">
        <t>
	  Link state algorithms distribute information for each
	  node to compute a tree representing the entire network.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Link state algorithms scale well in both very large and
	  very dense networks.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Distance-Vector Algorithm (Babel)">
	<t>
	  Distance-vector algorithms distribute information about the 
	  path length to reach each destination through a given 
	  neighbor.  Packets are forwarded to the neighbor who is 
	  advertising the shortest path to reach the destination.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Algorithm Comparison">
        <t>
          Loop-avoiding Distance Vector scales beautifully to very large
          networks -- the amount of state is linear in the number of
          nodes, and does not need to be propagated in a timely manner.
          It scales badly in extremely dense deployments, where a single
          node has thousands of direct neighbours; such deployments are
          unlikely, and clearly outside the scope of Homenet.
        </t>
        <t>
          Naive link state has somewhat worse scaling properties, since it
          has state that is proportional to the number of edges in the
          network graph, and requires strict state synchronisation between
          nodes.  Real-world link-state protocols work around that issue
          by splitting the network into multiple "areas", and performing
          distance-vector routing between areas.  It is unclear whether
          this workaround is suitable for Homenet.

    <section title="Support for Source-Specific Routing">
      <t>
	Source-Specific Routing is a hard requirement for HOMENETs, as
	it will allow traffic to be routed to the correct outbound
	network based on host source address selection.  Routing
	packets to the wrong outbound network could result in packets
	being dropped due to ISP ingress filtering rules.
      </t>
      <t>
	Both Babel and IS-IS have extensions for source-specific routing.
      </t>
      <section title="Source Specific Routing in IS-IS">
        <t>[XXX: chopps]</t>
        <t>
	  Reports indicate that IS-IS has critical issues (routing loops)
	  in a mixed environment where some routers support
	  Source-Specific Routing, and some routers do not.  However, this
	  is not likely to be a problem for Homenet, as we will require
	  Source-Specific Routing on all routers.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Source Specific Routing in Babel">
        <t>
          The Source-specific extension to the Babel routing protocol
          <xref target="BABEL-SS"/> has been implemented for over a year,
          has been made widely available and has seen a fair amount
          deployment as part of OpenWRT and CeroWRT.  The implementation
          is currently being merged into the standard Babel
          implementation, and is scheduled to be included in version 1.6
          (planned for March 2015).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Discussion">
        <t>
          Babel's source-specific extensions were carefully designed so
          that source-specific and ordinary (non-specific) routers can
          coexist in a single routing domain, without routing pathologies
          such as routing loops.  Interoperability between plain Babel and
          Source-Specific Babel is described in detail in Section VI.A of
          <xref target="SS-ROUTING"/>.
	</t>
        <t>
	  Reports indicate that source-specific IS-IS has critical issues
	  (routing loops) in a mixed environment where some routers
	  support Source-Specific Routing, and some routers do not.
	  However, this is not likely to be a problem for Homenet, as we
	  will require Source-Specific Routing on all routers.

    <section title="Support for Link Metrics">
      <section title="Link Metrics in IS-IS">
        <t>
          IS-IS supports 2 types of link metrics a legacy link metric (which
          should probably not be considered for HOMENET use) and a modern
          extended (24-bit) link metric. Additionally multi-topology support
          allows for a variable number of metrics per link.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Link Metrics in Babel">
        <t>
          In Babel, metrics are unsigned 16-bit integers, which means that
          metrics are arbitrary integers between 0 and 65534 (the value
          65535 is reserved to mean "infinity"); this has been found to be
          sufficient even in the chaotic environment of wireless mesh
          networks.  If needed, the Babel extension mechanism can be used
          to extend the metric space in arbitrary ways (not just
          integers), which has already been done by the radio interference
          extensions to Babel <xref target="BABEL-Z"/>.</t>

      <section title="IS-IS Support for Stub Networks">
        <t>
          A stub network in IS-IS is supported by the advertisement of
          reachability to a prefix by a router in its LSP. [How does this
          prevent the network from being used for transit? -- jch]
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Babel Supportt for Stub Networks">
        <t>
	  Babel supports flexible filtering of routes, and a stub

	Although the HOMENET WG has not yet determined how/if to

    <section title="Implementation Status">
      <t>
	There are Homenet implementations of both IS-IS and Babel.
      </t>
      <t>
        Only the Homenet implementation of IS-IS supports source-specific
        routing, which is a hard requirement for Homenet.  If
        source-specific routing is not required, there are several
        independent, interoperable implementations of IS-IS (all major
        router vendors implement IS-IS), including some open source
        implementations.
      </t>
      <t>
        There are multiple open source implementations of Babel, two of
        which support source-specific routing.  However, they were both
        originally derived from the same codebase.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Code and State Size">
      <section title="IS-IS Code and State Size">
        <t>
          The Homenet implementation of IS-IS consists of 7000 lines of
          Erlang code and has an installed size of over 11MB.  Its initial
          memory usage (as reported by the operating system) is 22MB, and
          its working set increases by XXX bytes for each new edge in the
          network graph.  To put these numbers into perspective, in
          a network with XXX nodes each of which has XXX neighbours, the
          Homenet implementation of IS-IS requires XXX bytes for its data
          structures.
        </t>
        <t>
          [I suggest removing the rest of this section, since it consists
          of unsubstantiated, vague claims depending on
          a not-yet-implemented version of a not-yet-specified subset of
          a large protocol. -- jch]
        </t>
	<t>
          The code size of IS-IS depends greatly on what aspects of the protocol
          have been implemented. IS-IS supports multiple address families as
          well as completely different protocol stacks (OSI and IP), multiple
          area hierachical operation with automatic virtual link support for
          repairing area partitions, and multiple link types. Additionally many
          other protocol features have been added over time to augment the
          protocol or replace previous behavior. The protocol lends itself well
          to not only extension, but pairing down of features.
        </t>
        <t>
          For HOMENET we could use a very simple level-2 only implementation
          supporting a common topology supporting IPv4 and IPv6 over broadcast
          (i.e., ethernet) link types. Additionally, we would need only support
          the latest extended metric TLV (i.e., not implement legacy metric
          support). Implemented as such the code size should be very manageable.
        </t>
        <t>
          The state actually required by IS-IS is not large, and primarily
          correlates to the number of routers in the network (for LSP
          storage). The protocol stores it's own link and adjacency data which
          is expected to be negligible. Additionally, the protocol stores
          received and generated LSPs, and typically an SPF tree with prefix
          information attached.  This state correlates directly to the number of
          routers and prefixes in the network. Each router in the network
          generates, a single LSP (possibly fragmented into segments) with
          prefix information, a single copy of these LSPs is stored by each
          router in the network regardless of the number of links, adjacencies
          or the distance (or number of hops) from the storing router to the
          advertising router.

      </section>
      <section title="Babel Code and State Size">
        <t>
	  The source-specific implementation of Babel, which
	  implements many non-Homenet extensions to the protocol,
	  consists of roughly 10000 lines of C and has an installed
	  size of less than 130kB on AMD-64.  Its initial memory usage
	  (as reported by the operating system) is 300kB.
	</t>
        <t>
	  The amount of state stored by a Babel router is at worst one
	  routing table entry for each destination through each
	  neighbour.  In the source-specific implementation, one
	  routing entry occupies roughly 100 bytes of memory.  To put
	  these figures into perspective, in a network with 1000
	  nodes, a Babel router with 10 neighbours needs roughly a
	  megabyte of memory to store its routing table (not counting
	  malloc overhead).</t> <t>The stub-only implementation of
	  Babel consists of 900 lines of C and compiles to 12kB
	  (dynamically linked).  Its memory usage (as reported by the

          Babel was carefully optimised for 802.11 networks.  In

            As all major routing vendors have IS-IS implementations as well as
            the existence of for sale and open source implementations, the
            barrier for implmeneting IS-IS for homenet use is quite low. Given
            this we can assume that willingness to implement modifications (if
            any) for homenet use is present and strong.

            Babel is a simple and flexible routing protocol.  Like most
            distance-vector protocols, it requires little to no
            configuration in most topologies, and has proved popular in
            scenarios where competent network administration was not
            available.  In addition, it has been shown to be particularly
            useful in scenarios where non-standard metrics were needed,
            notably wireless mesh networks and overlay networks.

            Babel is a fairly simple protocol -- RFC 6126 is just 40 pages
            long (not counting informative appendices), and it has been
            successfully explained to fourth year university students in
            less than two hours.

            The stub-only implementation of Babel consists of 900 lines of
            C code, and has deliberately been kept as simple as possible.

        <section title="IS-IS">

            As IS-IS already qualifies as successful (bordering on wildly) a killer

            Since Babel requires virtually no configuration, it is
            particularly suitable to scenarios where a dedicated network
            administrator is not available.  Additionally, its support for
            link quality sensing and non-standard metrics makes it
            particularly appealing in highly heterogeneous networks,
            (networks built on multiple link-layer technologies with
            widely varying performance characteristics).

          <t>
            IS-IS has been shown to be incredibly extensible, originally
            designed for a completely different protocol stack (OSI) it was
            easily adapted for IP use, then to multiple address families (IPv4,
            IPv6) and multi-topology. Indeed one of the major drivers of IS-IS's
            success is its extensibility and adaptability.

            Source-specific Babel is probably the only source-specific
            routing protocol that has seen a fair amount of deployment and
            is being used in production.
          </t>
          <t>
            Plain Babel has seen a modest amount of deployment, most
            notably for routing over wireless mesh networks and
            large-scale overlay networks.  However, it remains a young
            protocol, certainly much younger than IS-IS.
