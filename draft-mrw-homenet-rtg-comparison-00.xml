      <t>
	This document is intended to provide information to members of
	the IETF Home Networks Working Group (HOMENET WG), so that we
	can make an informed decision regarding which routing protocol
	to use in home networks.  The routing protocols compared
	in this document are: The Babel Routing Protocol (Babel) and
	The Intermediate System to Intermediate System Intra-Domain
	Routing Protocol (IS-IS).

    <section title="Introduction"> 
      <t>
	This document compares IS-IS (ISO/IEC 10589:2002) and Babel
	<xref target="RFC6126"/> across several criteria related to
	their use in home networks, as defined by the HOMENET WG
	(HOMENETs).
      </t>
      <t>
	Although there are substantial difference between the IS-IS
	and Babel routing protocols, both routing protocols work well,
	and either of them could be used in a home network.  There are
	many characteristics of these protocols that make them more or
	less suitable for use in HOMENETs, as defined in
	(reference homenet architecture and HNCP documents), and those
	characteristics are explored in this document.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Protocols and Extensions Included in Comparison">
      <t>
	Both IS-IS and Babel are living protocols that are updated and
	extended over time.  This section lists the extensions that
	were considered in this comparison.  Additional protocol
	extensions could affect some of the information included in this
	document.
      </t>
      <section title="IS-IS Protocol and Extensions">

	  In addition to the base IS-IS protocol specification

    <section title="Routing Algorithms">
      <t>
	IS-IS is a Link State routing protocol, and Babel is a
	Distance Vector routing protocol. There are some differences
	between these algorithms, particularly in terms of
	scalability, how much information is exchanged when the
	routing topology changes, and how far topology changes are
	propagated.

        [chopps: Perhaps we should see if we can find an external reference for
        comparing DVRP to link-state RPs for this section].

    <section title="Support for Source-Specific Routing">
      <t>
	Source-Specific Routing is a hard requirement for HOMENETs, as
	it will allow traffic to be routed to the correct outbound
	network based on host source address selection.  Routing
	packets to the wrong outbound network could result in packets
	being dropped due to ISP ingress filtering rules.

      </section>
      <section title="Discussion">
        <t>
	  Reports indicate that both IS-IS and Babel have critical
	  issues (routing loops) in a mixed environment where some
	  routers support Source-Specific Routing, and some routers do
	  not.  However, this is not likely to be a problem for Homenet,
	  as we will require Source-Specific Routing on all routers.

    <section title="Support for Link Metrics">
      <section title="Link Metrics in IS-IS">
        <t>
          IS-IS supports 2 types of link metrics a legacy link metric (which
          should probably not be considered for HOMENET use) and a modern
          extended (24-bit) link metric. Additionally multi-topology support
          allows for a variable number of metrics per link.

          using any number of hashing algorithms (e.g., HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1,

	Although the HOMENET WG has not yet determined how/if to
	support multicast in HOMENET Networks, it might be desirable
	to pick a routing protocol that supports multicast, so that it
	will be easier to add multicast support in the future.

    <section title="Implementation Status">
      <t>
	There are Homenet implementations of both IS-IS and Babel.
      </t>
      <t>
	There are several independent, interoperable implementations of IS-IS
	(all major router vendors implement IS-IS), including multiple open
	source implementations.  There is one open source implementation of
	Babel.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Code and State Size">
      <section title="IS-IS Code and State Size">
	<t>
          The code size of IS-IS depends greatly on what aspects of the protocol
          have been implemented. IS-IS supports multiple address families as
          well as completely different protocol stacks (OSI and IP), multiple
          area hierachical operation with automatic virtual link support for
          repairing area partitions, and multiple link types. Additionally many
          other protocol features have been added over time to augment the
          protocol or replace previous behavior. The protocol lends itself well
          to not only extension, but pairing down of features.
        </t>
        <t>
          For HOMENET we could use a very simple level-2 only implementation
          supporting a common topology supporting IPv4 and IPv6 over broadcast
          (i.e., ethernet) link types. Additionally, we would need only support
          the latest extended metric TLV (i.e., not implement legacy metric
          support). Implemented as such the code size should be very manageable.
        </t>
        <t>
          The state actually required by IS-IS is not large, and primarily
          correlates to the number of routers in the network (for LSP
          storage). The protocol stores it's own link and adjacency data which
          is expected to be negligible. Additionally, the protocol stores
          received and generated LSPs, and typically an SPF tree with prefix
          information attached.  This state correlates directly to the number of
          routers and prefixes in the network. Each router in the network
          generates, a single LSP (possibly fragmented into segments) with
          prefix information, a single copy of these LSPs is stored by each
          router in the network regardless of the number of links, adjacencies
          or the distance (or number of hops) from the storing router to the
          advertising router.
