1.  Introduction

   This document compares IS-IS (ISO/IEC 10589:2002) [RFC1142] and Babel
   [RFC6126] across several criteria related to their use in home
   networks, as defined by the HOMENET WG (HOMENETs).

   The Homenet environment is different from the environment of a
   professionally administered network.  The most obvious difference is
   that a Homenet is not administered: any protocols used must be robust
   and fully self-configuring, and any tuning knobs that they provide
   will be unused in the vast majority of deployments.

   Another difference is that Homenets are usually built out of a
   specific class of cheap device, the "Plastic Home Router".  A PHR's
   firmware is installed at the factory, and is most likely never
   updated.  Additionally, experience shows that home routers are often
   used way beyond their warranty period, and even after their
   manufacturer leaves the router business.  This, again, argues in



Wasserman, et al.        Expires August 16, 2015                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   favour of simple, robust protocols that are easy to implement and can
   be expected to keep functioning without software updates.

   Homenets are built and grow organically, and often end up consisting
   of multiple link technologies with widely different performance
   characteristics (twisted-pair Ethernet, IEEE 802.11 and its multiple
   variants, Powerline Ethernet, etc.).  It is desirable for a Homenet
   routing protocol to be able to dynamically optimise paths according
   to the link technology.

   Contrary to popular perception, the Plastic Home Router is usually
   equipped with a fairly fast CPU and reasonable amounts of flash and
   RAM; at the time of writing, a 700MHz MIPS CPU with 16MB of flash and
   64MB of RAM is typical.  However, we expect smaller devices to
   participate in the Homenet protocols, at least as stub routers.  The
   ability to scale down the Homenet protocols is therefore likely to
   encourage their wider adoption.

   Experts appear to disagree on the expected size of a Homenet; we have
   heard estimates ranging from just one router up to 250 routers.  In
   any case, while scaling beyond a few thousand nodes is not likely to
   be relevant to Homenet in the foreseeable future, the Homenet
   protocols, if successful, will be repurposed to larger networks,
   whether we like it or not, and using a protocol that scales well from
   the outset may avoid trouble in the future.

2.  Protocols and Extensions Included in Comparison

   Both IS-IS and Babel are living protocols that are updated and
   extended over time.  This section lists the extensions that were
   considered in this comparison.  Additional protocol extensions could
   affect some of the information included in this document.

2.1.  IS-IS Protocol and Extensions

   In addition to the base IS-IS protocol specification (ISO/IEC
   10589:2002), this comparison considers the following IS-IS
   extensions:

   o  ISIS Auto-Configuration [ISIS-AUTOCONF];

   o  Source-Specific routing in IS-IS (XXX reference?).

2.2.  Babel Protocol and Extensions

   In addition to the base Babel Protocol specification (RFC 6126), this
   comparison considers the following Babel extensions:

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   o  Extension Mechanism for the Babel Routing Protocol [BABEL-EXT];

   o  Source-Specific Routing [BABEL-SS], described in more detail in
      [SS-ROUTING].

3.  Routing Algorithms

   IS-IS is a Link State routing protocol, and Babel is a Loop-avoiding
   Distance Vector routing protocol.  There are some differences between
   these algorithms, particularly in terms of scalability, how much
   information is exchanged when the routing topology changes, and how
   far topology changes are propagated.  [chopps: Perhaps we should see
   if we can find an external reference for comparing DVRP to link-state
   RPs for this section].

3.1.  Link State Algorithm

   Link state algorithms distribute information for each node to compute
   a tree representing the entire network.

   Link state algorithms scale well in both very large and very dense
   networks.

   [I strongly object to this claim.  The scaling results available in
   the open litterature apply to hybrid routing -- level 1-2 in IS-IS
   parlance.  However, later in this document we argue that for Homenet
   IS-IS should be scaled down by removing multi-area support, making it
   into a naive link-state protocol, which is known to have scalability
   issues unless it is augmented with other mechanisms. -- jch]

   [chopps: what is the definition of very large?  For sub-1000 node
   networks a single area suffices -- theres no argument about density
   scaling right?]

3.2.  Loop-Avoiding Distance-Vector Algorithm (Babel)

   Distance-vector algorithms distribute information about the path
   length to reach each destination through a given neighbor.  Packets
   are forwarded to the neighbor who is advertising the shortest path to
   reach the destination.

   Babel, like EIGRP, DSDV and to a certain extent BGP, uses a loop-
   avoiding distance-vector algorithm: it avoids creating a loop even
   during reconvergence (there is no "counting to infinity", and even
   short-lived "microloops" are avoided in most cases).

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


3.3.  Algorithm Comparison

   [Putting this so early in the document gives undue import to scaling
   issues. -- jch]

   Loop-avoiding Distance Vector scales beautifully to very large
   networks -- the amount of state is linear in the number of nodes,
   and, due to the absence of pathologies during reconvergence, does not
   need to be propagated in a timely manner.  It scales badly in
   extremely dense deployments, where a single node has thousands of
   direct neighbours; such deployments are unlikely, and clearly outside
   the scope of Homenet.  [chopps: wouldn't 802.11 be an example of a
   somewhat dense network?]

   The IS-IS link state algorithm distributes link and prefix
   information for each node in a single Logical LSP (possibly
   fragmented).  It uses these LSPs to compute a tree representing the
   entire network.  There is no duplication of state based on the number
   of adjacencies or unique paths to a given prefix.

3.3.1.  Converence Times

   Isn't this important?  For example if one is on a phone call over
   wifi, etc.

   [This is somewhat disingenious, since convergence time is dwarfed by
   the time needed to detect link failure -- which is two hello
   intervals in Babel (8s by default), and one hold time in IS-IS (30s
   by default in Cisco's implementation).  We should not be raising
   expectations by making misleading claims, and I therefore strongly
   object to this section as it stands now.  -- jch]

3.3.1.1.  IS-IS

   Given fast flooding of any change in the network, IS-IS has been
   shown to acheive sub 200ms end-to-end convergence even in very large
   provider networks (900+ nodes).  Basically the time for convergence
   is the time to propagate a new LSP from one end of the network to the
   other plus the SPF (tree computation interval) and FIB loading time.
   The flooding is done without delay and prior to running the SPF
   (tree-calculation) algorithm.  Thus is roughly proportional to
   propagation delay across the diameter of the network.  The tree
   calculation is sub 20ms on modern CPUs.  FIB load time depends on the
   FIB hardware and design and not the routing protocol choice.  We
   easily should expect sub-second convergence for any change in
   reachability (addition or subtraction) in any conceivable homenet
   deployment.

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


3.3.1.2.  Babel

   Since Babel maintains a redundant routing table, it is most often
   able to reconverge almost instantaneously after a link failure (this
   is similar to e.g.  EIGRP).  In the case where no feasible routes are
   available, Babel reconverges in 20ms per hop to the source.

4.  Autoconfiguration

   Home networks are not administered, so a routing protocol needs to be
   entirely self-configuring in order to be suitable for Homenet.

4.1.  IS-IS

   The only required configuration for IS-IS is a unique area/system
   identifier.  The Homenet variant of IS-IS uses an autoconfiguration
   extension defined in an Internet Draft [ISIS-AUTOCONF], to set this
   value.

4.2.  Babel

   Babel is a fully self-configuring protocol -- the standard
   implementation of Babel only requires a list of interfaces in order
   to start routing.

4.3.  Discussion

5.  Support for Source-Specific Routing

   Source-Specific Routing is a hard requirement for HOMENETs, as it
   will allow traffic to be routed to the correct outbound network based
   on host source address selection.  Routing packets to the wrong
   outbound network could result in packets being dropped due to ISP
   ingress filtering rules.

   Both Babel and IS-IS have extensions for source-specific routing.

5.1.  Source-Specific Routing in IS-IS

   [XXX: chopps]

   Reports indicate that IS-IS has critical issues (routing loops) in a
   mixed environment where some routers support Source-Specific Routing,
   and some routers do not.  However, this is not likely to be a problem
   for Homenet, as we will require Source-Specific Routing on all
   routers.

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   [How will we enforce that?  What happens if someone plugs a non-
   source-specific stub router into a Homenet?  Does the Homenet
   collapse?  -- jch]

5.2.  Source-Specific Routing in Babel

   The Source-specific extension to the Babel routing protocol
   [BABEL-SS] has been implemented for over a year, has been made widely
   available and has seen a fair amount deployment as part of OpenWRT
   and CeroWRT.  The source-specific code is currently in the process of
   being merged into the standard Babel implementation, and is scheduled
   to be included in version 1.6 (planned for March 2015).

5.3.  Discussion

   Babel's source-specific extensions were carefully designed so that
   source-specific and ordinary (non-specific) routers can coexist in a
   single routing domain, without routing pathologies such as routing
   loops.  Interoperability between plain Babel and Source-Specific
   Babel is described in detail in Section VI.A of [SS-ROUTING].

6.  Support for Link Metrics

6.1.  Link Metrics in IS-IS

   The homenet version of IS-IS uses the wide-metric (24-bit) link
   metric.  Additionally IS-IS includes multi-topology support allowing
   for a variable number of metrics per link, as well as per-link and
   per-prefix tags allowing for coloring of links and reachability, and
   finally per-link and per-prefix sub-tlv's allowing for any future
   additional extensions.

6.2.  Link Metrics in Babel

   Since Babel was originally designed for heterogeneous networks, it is
   able to dynamically assign metrics to links depending on their lower-
   layer characteristics.  In practice, Babel assigns lower (better)
   metrics to wired links than to wireless ones, dynamically measures
   loss rates in order to favour lossless wireless links, favours routes
   with non-interfering radio frequencies, and avoids high-latency
   tunnels.

   Obviously, such a wealth of information can lead to contradictory
   data in edge cases; however, Babel's loop-avoidance mechanisms ensure
   that the network remains in a consistent state in all cases, and a
   hysteresis mechanism ensures that, should a feedback loop occur, the
   frequency of oscillations remains bounded [DELAY-BASED].

7.  Support for Attached Stub Networks

   A stub network is one that is attached to a Homenet, possibly through
   multiple Homenet routers, but must not be used for transit.  For
   example, a stub network could be a sensor network which would
   collapse under the Homenet traffic should it ever be used for
   transit.

   In the following example, if the dotted link between C and D is a
   stub network, then it must not be used for transit even if the link
   between A and B fails:

   ---- A ----- B -----
        |       |
        |       |
        C ..... D

7.1.  IS-IS Support for Stub Networks

   A stub network in IS-IS is supported by the advertisement of
   reachability to a prefix by a router in its LSP.  [How does this
   prevent the network from being used for transit? -- jch]

7.2.  Babel Support for Stub Networks

   Babel supports flexible filtering of routes, and a stub network can
   be designated by simply setting up the necessary filtering rules.
   For resource-limited deployments, a minimalistic, stub-only
   implementation of Babel is available.

8.  Security Features

   [I think this section is badly written.  We should just state whether
   each protocol supports auth or encryption, and whether it supports
   symmetric or something more exciting.  Listing password
   authentication seems silly. -- jch]

8.1.  Security Features in IS-IS

   IS-IS offers multiple levels of security from none, to simple clear-
   text (password) authentication, to fully generic cryptographic
   authentication using any number of hashing algorithms (e.g., HMAC-
   MD5, HMAC-SHA1, ... HMAC-SHA512) based on security associations
   (link, area and domain scoped).

   [What does that mean?  Just support for symmetric-key HMAC-based
   authentication, or am I missing something?  And why the mention of

   areas if we're arguing in favour of a single-area implementation?  --
   jch]

8.2.  Security Features in Babel

   Babel supports symmetric key authentication using an extensible HMAC-
   based cryptographic authentication mechanism [RFC7298].

9.  Support for Multicast

   Although the HOMENET WG has not yet determined how/if to support
   multicast in HOMENET Networks, it might be desirable to pick a
   routing protocol that supports multicast, so that it will be easier
   to add multicast support in the future.

9.1.  Multicast Routing in IS-IS

   The IS-IS protocol supports multicast routing.  However, none of the
   available implementations include support for multicast.  [XXX:
   chopps: what do we mean by supporting multicast routing?]

9.2.  Multicast Routing in Babel

   There is no support for multicast routing in Babel.

10.  Implementation Status

   There are Homenet implementations of both IS-IS and Babel.

   Only the Homenet implementation of IS-IS supports source-specific
   routing, which is a hard requirement for Homenet.  If source-specific
   routing is not required, there are several independent, interoperable
   proprietary implementations of IS-IS (all major router vendors
   implement IS-IS).  We are not aware of any production-quality open-
   source implementation of IS-IS other than the Homenet one.

   There are multiple open source implementations of Babel, two of which
   support source-specific routing.  Both were originally derived from
   the same codebase.

11.  Code and State Size

11.1.  IS-IS Code and State Size

   The Homenet implementation of IS-IS consists of 7000 lines of Erlang
   code and has an installed size of over 11MB.  Its initial memory
   usage (as reported by the operating system) is 22MB, and its working
   set increases by XXX bytes for each new edge in the network graph.



Wasserman, et al.        Expires August 16, 2015               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   To put these numbers into perspective, in a network with XXX nodes
   each of which has XXX neighbours, the Homenet implementation of IS-IS
   requires XXX bytes for its data structures.

   [I suggest removing the rest of this section, since it consists of
   unsubstantiated, vague claims depending on a not-yet-implemented
   version of a not-yet-specified subset of a large protocol. -- jch]

   The code size of IS-IS depends greatly on what aspects of the
   protocol have been implemented.  IS-IS supports multiple address
   families as well as completely different protocol stacks (OSI and
   IP), multiple area hierachical operation with automatic virtual link
   support for repairing area partitions, and multiple link types.
   Additionally many other protocol features have been added over time
   to augment the protocol or replace previous behavior.  The protocol
   lends itself well to not only extension, but pairing down of
   features.

   For HOMENET we could use a very simple level-2 only implementation
   supporting a common topology supporting IPv4 and IPv6 over broadcast
   (i.e., ethernet) link types.  Additionally, we would need only
   support the latest extended metric TLV (i.e., not implement legacy
   metric support).  Implemented as such the code size should be very
   manageable.

   The state actually required by IS-IS is not large, and primarily
   correlates to the number of routers in the network (for LSP storage).
   The protocol stores it's own link and adjacency data which is
   expected to be negligible.  Additionally, the protocol stores
   received and generated LSPs, and typically an SPF tree with prefix
   information attached.  This state correlates directly to the number
   of routers and prefixes in the network.  Each router in the network
   generates, a single LSP (possibly fragmented into segments) with
   prefix information, a single copy of these LSPs is stored by each
   router in the network regardless of the number of links, adjacencies
   or the distance (or number of hops) from the storing router to the
   advertising router.

11.2.  Babel Code and State Size

   The source-specific implementation of Babel, which implements many
   non-Homenet extensions to the protocol, consists of roughly 10000
   lines of C and has an installed size of less than 130kB on AMD-64.
   Its initial memory usage (as reported by the operating system) is
   300kB.

   The amount of state stored by a Babel router is at worst one routing
   table entry for each destination through each neighbour.  In the



Wasserman, et al.        Expires August 16, 2015               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   source-specific implementation, one routing entry occupies roughly
   100 bytes of memory.  To put these figures into perspective, in a
   network with 1000 nodes, a Babel router with 10 neighbours needs
   roughly a megabyte of memory to store its routing table (not counting
   malloc overhead).

   The stub-only implementation of Babel consists of 900 lines of C and
   compiles to 12kB (dynamically linked).  Its memory usage (as reported
   by the operating system) is 200kB, and remains constant (it doesn't
   perform any dynamic memory allocation).

   In this table, "Installed size" is the size reported by the package
   manager for the routing daemon's package(s) (including the 1.6MB of
   the "Beam" Erlang VM in the case of IS-IS), while "Total installed

12.  Performance on IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks

12.1.  IS-IS Performance on 802.11

   IS-IS is in active use in in the Internet in large non-hierachical
   (i.e., level-2 or single area level-1) deployments with hundreds of
   nodes.  The protocol has proven to be very scalable.



Wasserman, et al.        Expires August 16, 2015               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   Do we have any information about the performance of IS-IS on 802.11
   networks, in particular?

12.2.  Babel Performance on 802.11

   Babel was carefully optimised for 802.11 networks.  In particular, it
   performs link quality estimations of wireless links in a manner that
   works well with the 802.11 MAC.  In addition, Babel has provisions
   for estimating radio interference [BABEL-Z], which is essential for
   providing decent throughput on multi-hop radio routes.

   Babel was designed to work well on pure mesh networks (networks where
   a packet might exit through the same interface as the one it came
   from), but this is probably out of scope for Homenet.

13.  Standardization Status

13.1.  IS-IS Standardization

   IS-IS is an ISO Standard documented in ISO/IEC 10589:2002.  There is
   an active IETF IS-IS Working Group (ISIS) that maintains and extends
   the IS-IS protocol, and the IS-IS protocol has been extended in
   several ISIS Working Group documents.

   The autoconfiguration and source-specific extensions to IS-IS, which
   are both hard requirements for Homenet, are documented in Internet
   Drafts.

13.2.  Babel Standardization Status

   Babel is documented in an Experimental RFC (RFC 6126) published in
   2011, and it has been updated in several individual-submission RFCs
   and Internet Drafts.  An Internet Draft establishing an IANA registry
   of Babel extensions has been submitted for publication as an RFC
   [BABEL-EXT].

   The use of Babel in a Standards Track HOMENET RFC would require a
   "downref" to non-Standards Track documents.  It would also be
   necessary to finish publishing the extensions that are needed for the
   HOMENET use case as RFCs.

14.  Evaluation of RFC 5218 Criteria

   [I recommend removing this section, it reads like marketese.  -- jch]

14.1.  Critical Success Factors

   Does the protocol exhibit one or more of the critical initial success
   factors as defined in RFC 5218?

14.1.1.  IS-IS Success Factors

   IS-IS exhibits the following critical initial success factors:

      Positive Net Value:

         Hardware cost: None.

      No Hard Scalability bound: Yes.

      Threats Sufficiently Mitigated: Yes.

14.1.2.  Babel Success Factos

   Babel exhibits the following critical initial success factors:

      Positive Net Value:

         Hardware cost: None.

      Threats Sufficiently Mitigated: probably.

14.2.  Willing Implementors

   Are there implementers who are ready to implement the technology in
   ways that are likely to be deployed?

14.2.1.  IS-IS

   There is only one implementation of autoconfiguration and source-
   specific routing for IS-IS.  There are some other open source
   implementations of the base protocol, but they are incomplete (as of
   February 2015).

   As all major routing vendors have (proprietary) IS-IS
   implementations, the barrier for implmeneting IS-IS for homenet use
   is probably manageable, assuming that the willingness to implement
   modifications needed for Homenet use is present.

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


14.2.2.  Babel

   The Babel implementation is open source software (MIT licensed), and
   the codebase has proven of sufficiently high quality to be easily
   extended by people who were not in direct contact with the author
   [RFC7298].

14.3.  Willing Customers

   Are there customers (especially high-profile customers) who are ready
   to deploy the technology?

14.3.1.  IS-IS

   Yes.  IS-IS is already widely deployed in operational networks.

   [I suggest more details should be given.  Recall that we're speaking
   of source-specific IS-IS here. -- jch]

14.3.2.  Babel

   Source-Specific Babel is currently deployed as part of the OpenWRT
   and CeroWRT operating systems.  Additionally, the current version is
   used as a testbed for the Homenet configuration protocol.

14.4.  Potential Niches

   Are there potential niches where the technology is compelling?

14.4.1.  IS-IS

14.4.2.  Babel

   Babel is a simple and flexible routing protocol.  Like most distance-
   vector protocols, it requires little to no configuration in most
   topologies, and has proved popular in scenarios where competent
   network administration was not available.  In addition, it has been
   shown to be particularly useful in scenarios where non-standard
   dynamically computed metrics are beneficial, notably wireless mesh
   networks and overlay networks.

14.5.  Complexity Removal

   If so, can complexity be removed to reduce cost?







Wasserman, et al.        Expires August 16, 2015               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


14.5.1.  IS-IS

   As mentioned previously IS-IS can be significantly and easily pared
   down to fit the more limited scope of homenet use.  However, no such
   pared down implementation exists, and the subset of the protocol that
   needs to be implemented has never been formally defined.

14.5.2.  Babel

   Babel is a fairly simple protocol -- RFC 6126 is just 40 pages long
   (not counting informative appendices), and it has been successfully
   explained to fourth year university students in less than two hours.

   The stub-only implementation of Babel consists of 900 lines of C
   code, and has deliberately been kept as simple as possible.  We
   expect a competent engineer to get up to speed with it within hours.

14.6.  Killer App

   Is there a potential killer app?  Or can the technology work
   underneath existing unmodified applications?

14.6.1.  IS-IS

   As IS-IS already qualifies as successful (bordering on wildly) a
   killer app is not particularly relevant.

14.6.2.  Babel

   Since Babel requires virtually no configuration, it is particularly
   suitable to scenarios where a dedicated network administrator is not
   available.  Additionally, its support for dynamically computed non-
   standard metrics makes it particularly appealing in highly
   heterogeneous networks, (networks built on multiple link-layer
   technologies with widely varying performance characteristics).

14.7.  Extensible

   Is the protocol sufficiently extensible to allow potential
   deficiencies to be addressed in the future?

14.7.1.  IS-IS

   IS-IS has been shown to be incredibly extensible, originally designed
   for a completely different protocol stack (OSI) it was easily adapted
   for IP use, then to multiple address families (IPv4, IPv6) and multi-
   topology.  Indeed one of the major drivers of IS-IS's success is its
   extensibility and adaptability.

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


14.7.2.  Babel

   The extension mechanisms built into the Babel protocol [BABEL-EXT]
   have been shown to be a solid basis on which many backwards-
   compatible extensions have been built, including one that
   fundamentally changes the structure of announcements [BABEL-SS] and
   one that needs a non-trivial extension to the space of metrics
   [BABEL-Z].

14.8.  Success Predictable

   If it is not known whether the protocol will be successful, should
   the market decide first?  Or should the IETF work on multiple
   alternatives and let the market decide among them?  Are there factors
   listed in this document that may predict which is more likely to
   succeed?

14.8.1.  IS-IS

   For IS-IS the market has already decided that the protocol is
   successful in a fairly wide variety of deployments.  [We're speaking
   of source-specific, autoconfiguring IS-IS here?  And are we speaking
   of small, unadministered networks? -- jch]

14.8.2.  Babel

   Source-specific Babel is probably the only source-specific routing
   protocol that has seen deployment and is being used in production.

   Plain Babel has seen a modest amount of deployment, most notably for
   routing over wireless mesh networks and large-scale overlay networks.
   However, it remains a young protocol, certainly much younger than IS-
   IS.
