Abstract

   This document is intended to provide information to members of the
   IETF Home Networks Working Group (HOMENET WG), so that we can make an
   informed decision regarding which routing protocol to use in home
   networks.  The routing protocols compared in this document are: The
   Babel Routing Protocol (Babel) and The Intermediate System to
   Intermediate System Intra-Domain Routing Protocol (IS-IS).

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      November 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document compares IS-IS (ISO/IEC 10589:2002) and Babel [RFC6126]
   across several criteria related to their use in home networks, as
   defined by the HOMENET WG (HOMENETs).

   Although there are substantial difference between the IS-IS and Babel
   routing protocols, both routing protocols work well, and either of
   them could be used in a home network.  There are many characteristics
   of these protocols that make them more or less suitable for use in
   HOMENETs, as defined in (reference homenet architecture and HNCP
   documents), and those characteristics are explored in this document.

2.  Protocols and Extensions Included in Comparison

   Both IS-IS and Babel are living protocols that are updated and
   extended over time.  This section lists the extensions that were
   considered in this comparison.  Additional protocol extensions could
   affect some of the information included in this document.

2.1.  IS-IS Protocol and Extensions

   In addition to the base IS-IS protocol specification (ISO/IEC
   10589:2002), this comparison considers the following IS-IS
   extensions:

2.2.  Babel Protocol and Extensions

   In addition to the base Babel Protocol specification (RFC 6126), this
   comparison considers the following Babel extensions:

3.  Routing Algorithms

   IS-IS is a Link State routing protocol, and Babel is a Distance
   Vector routing protocol.  There are some differences between these
   algorithms, particularly in terms of scalability, how much
   information is exchanged when the routing topology changes, and how
   far topology changes are propogated.

3.1.  Link State Algorithm

3.2.  Distance Vector Algorithm (Babel)

3.3.  Algorithm Comparison

4.  Support for Source-Specific Routing

   Source-Specific Routing is a hard requirement for HOMENETs, as it
   will allow traffic to be routed to the correct outbound network based
   on host source address selection.  Routing packets to the wrong
   outbound network could result in packets being dropped due to ISP
   ingress filtering rules.

4.1.  Source Specific Routing in IS-IS

4.2.  Source Specific Routing in Babel

4.3.  Discussion

   Reports indicate that both IS-IS and Babel have critical issues
   (routing loops) in a mixed environment where some routers support
   Source-Specific Routing, and some routers do not.  However, this is
   not likely to be a problem for Homenet, as we will require Source-
   Specific Routing on all routers.

5.  Support for Link Metrics

5.1.  Link Metrics in IS-IS

5.2.  Link Metrics in Babel

5.3.  Discussion

6.  Support for Attached Stub Networks

6.1.  IS-IS Support for Stub Networks

6.2.  Babel Supportt for Stub Networks

7.  Security Features

7.1.  Security Features in IS-IS

7.2.  Security Features in Babel

8.  Support for Multicast

   Although the HOMENET WG has not yet determined how/if to support
   multicast in HOMENET Networks, it might be desirable to pick a
   routing protocol that supports multicast, so that it will be easier
   to add multicast support in the future.

8.1.  Multicast Routing in IS-IS

   IS-IS supports multicast routing.

8.2.  Multicast Routing in Babel

   Does Babel support multicast routing at all?  It is not mentioned in
   the published RFC.

9.  Implementation Status

   There are Homenet implementations of both IS-IS and Babel.

   There are several independent, interoperable implementations of IS-
   IS, including open source implementations.  There is one open source
   implementation of Babel.

10.  Code and Data Size

10.1.  IS-IS Code and Data Size

   TBD -- Does anyone have information on this?

10.2.  Babel Code and Data Size

11.  Scalablity on IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks

11.1.  IS-IS Scalability on 802.11

11.2.  Babel Scalability on 802.11

12.  Standardization Status

12.1.  IS-IS Standardization

   IS-IS is an ISO Standard documented in ISO/IEC 10589:2002.  There is
   an active IETF IS-IS Working Group (ISIS) that maintains and extends
   the IS-IS protocol, and the IS-IS protocol has been extended in
   several ISIS Working Group documents.

12.2.  Babel Standardization Status

   Babel is documented in an Experimental RFC (RFC 6126) published in
   2011, and it has been updated in several individual-submission RFCs.

   The use of Babel in a Standards Track HOMENET RFC would require a
   "down ref" to non-Standards Track documents.  It would also be

   necessary to publish the extensions that are needed for the HOMENET
   use case as RFCs.
